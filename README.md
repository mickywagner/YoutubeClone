<h3>About This Project</h3>
<p>This is an HTML/CSS only Youtube Clone I did for a project while working my way through the HTML/CSS course that's part of the Full Stack Javascript track on <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">Odin Project</a>.
This was the second project on the course and the idea was to just practice using the HTML video player and having media show up. No Javascript is used so there's very little to no functionality here, it's just CSS/HTML study.
